# CSS Hover Effect Button

A basic webpage demonstrating a hover effect on a button using only CSS.

## What is Hover?

Hover means when the mouse pointer is placed over an element without clicking. The element changes visually to indicate interaction.

## How it Works

- The button changes background color smoothly on hover.
- It also slightly enlarges to give a subtle zoom effect.
- This is done using the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class and CSS transitions.
